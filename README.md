# Final_Project_Rock_Paper_Scissors

 This is my final project for Udacity's course: Inro into Programming: Python 2
 
In this project, you'll apply your Python and object-oriented 
programming skills to build a program that plays the game of Rock 
Paper Scissors. You'll build classes that represent the game and 
its players. You'll write computer players that follow various 
different strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a 
human play the game against the computer.
